# This file contains code for functions that are simply expected points and win
# probability calculators. The purpose of this is to make it easier for hypothetical
# situation calculations as well as for use in Shiny apps.

#' Compute expected points for provided play-by-play dataset
#' 
#' Given a dataset of plays and the necessary variables, this function returns
#' the original dataset with columns appended from the expected points model.
#' The user is also allowed to input values of the different scoring events,
#' for instance if they believe a TD is more likely to be worth 6 or 8 points.
#' 
#' @param pbp_data Play-by-play dataset to estimate expected points for.
#' @param half_seconds_remaining String denoting the name of the column of the
#' pbp_data containing the number of seconds remaining in the current half.
#' @param yard_line_100 String denoting the name of the column of the pbp_data
#' containing the yards away from the opponents' endzone.
#' @param down String denoting the name of the column of the pbp_data containing
#' the down of the play.
#' @param yards_to_go String denoting the name of the column of the pbp_data 
#' containing the yards to go for a first down of the play.
#' @param goal_to_go String denoting the name of the column of the pbp_data
#' containing the indicator for whether or not the play is in a goal down 
#' situation.
#' @param td_value Numeric point value for a TD occurring, default is 7.
#' @param fg_value Numeric point value for a FG occurring, default is 3.
#' @param safety_value Numeric point value for a safety occurring, default is 2.
#' @return The original pbp_data with the following columns appended to it:
#' ep (expected points), no_score_prob (probability of no score occurring until
#' the end of the half), opp_fg_prob (probability of opposing team scoring a 
#' field goal next), opp_safety_prob (probability of opposing team scoring a 
#' safety next), opp_td_prob (probability of opposing team scoring a TD next),
#' fg_prob (probability of possession team scoring a field goal next), 
#' safety_prob (probability of possession team scoring a safety next), and 
#' td_prob (probability of possession team scoring a touchdown next).
